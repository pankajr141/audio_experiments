Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a powerful meta-heuristic optimization algorithm and inspired by swarm behavior observed in nature such as fish and bird schooling. 
In nature, any of the birdâ€™s observable vicinity is limited to some range. However, having more than one birds allows all the birds in a swarm to be aware of the larger surface of a fitness function

# Advantages of PSO
* Insensitive to scaling of design variables.
* Derivative free.
* Very few algorithm parameters.
* Very efficient global search algorithm.
* Easily parallelized for concurrent processing.
