Metaheuristic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms that are used to find solutions to complex problems
They are designed to find good solutions to problems that are difficult to solve to optimality, often with limited resources

Metaheuristics are typically defined by their heuristic nature, emphasizing exploration and exploitation <b>without necessarily modeling the objective function probabilistically or statistically</b>

# characteristics of metaheuristic algorithms
* <b>Stochastic </b> \
They start by generating random results, which helps them avoid premature convergence.
* <b>Derivative-free </b> \
They don't require calculating derivatives in the search space, which makes them simpler and more flexible.
* <b>Balance exploration and profit </b> \
They examine interesting regions of the search space, then perform local searches in those regions.

# examples of metaheuristic algorithms include: 
* <b>Genetic Algorithm (GA) </b> \
Inspired by natural selection and genetics, GA starts by randomly generating a population of solutions, then evolves it using operators like selection, crossover, and mutation.
* <b>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) </b> \
Inspired by the collective behaviour of social organisms, PSO starts by randomly generating a swarm of particles, each representing a potential solution.
* <b>Simulated Annealing (SA) </b> \
Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, SA starts by randomly generating an initial solution, then gradually reduces the temperature of the system.
* <b>Tabu Search (TS) </b> \
Inspired by the concept of memory in human decision-making, TS starts by randomly generating an initial solution, then searches the neighbourhood of the solution by applying operators like swapping or reversing.
