# Experiments
This Repository contains the code base for performing some experiments. Codebase presented here might be used as fullscale repository in future works, if the codebase is generalizable and solve a particular problem.


# Explanations
Detailed discussion regarding each experment will be layed across different medium as follows. 

## Problem Defination 
First we are going to lay out the problem. Each problem will be presented in 2 mediums.

## Solution Presentation
For each problem soultion will be presented in different medium, 
* Video (Youtube)
* Blog - https://pankajr141.wordpress.com
* Github - https://github.com/pankajr141/experiments
* Github Gist - https://gist.github.com/pankajr141  

Github and Github Gist are identical and will contain jupyter notebook will will also include youtube video as an embedded file.
